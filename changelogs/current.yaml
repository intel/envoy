bug_fixes:
- area: listener
  change: |
    fixed a bug that doesn't handle of an update for a listener with IPv4-mapped address correctly and that will lead to a memory leak.
# *Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*
- area: http
  change: |
    fixed a bug with internal redirects not being performed for drained connections.
- area: listener
  change: |
    fixed a bug that doesn't handle of an update for a listener with IPv4-mapped address correctly, and that will lead to a memory leak.
- area: transport_socket
  change: |
    fixed a bug that prevented the tcp stats to be retrieved when running on kernels different than the kernel where Envoy was built.
- area: logger
  change: |
    added the %j and %_ format support for fine-grain loggers to make it consistant with default loggers.
- area: router
  change: |
    fixed edge-case interaction between weighted clusters, cluster headers and (request|response)_headers_to_(add|remove).
- area: upstream
  change: |
    fixed a bug where custom transport socket hashes might not be respected by wrapper passthrough sockets. This change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy.reloadable_features.fix_hash_key`` to false.

new_features:
- area: header_formatters
  change: |
    all access log formatters can be used as custom request/response headers. Custom header's syntax is parsed using access logger's parser and
    header values are obtained using access log's substitution formatters. This feature can be reversed by setting runtime guard
    ``envoy.reloadable_features.unified_header_formatter`` to false.

  change: |
    added default-false ``envoy.reloadable_features.http1_use_balsa_parser`` for experimental BalsaParser.
  change: |
    added ``envoy.reloadable_features.allow_upstream_filters`` for experimental upstream filters.

  change: |
    added stats for downstream connection close to detect SR drop.

  change: |
    added support for :ref:`choose_first<envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.compressor.v3.Compressor>`.
- area: cors
  change: |
    added support for cors PNA. This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard ``envoy_reloadable_features_cors_private_network_access`` to false. More details refer to https://developer.chrome.com/blog/private-network-access-preflight.

  change: |
    allow network filters other than HTTP Connection Manager to be created for QUIC listeners.
- area: lua
  change: |
    added an alternative function signature to ``httpCall()`` with ``options`` as an argument. This allows to skip sampling the produced trace span
    by setting ``{["trace_sampled"] = false}`` as the ``options``. And this allows to return multiple header values for same header name by setting
    ``{["return_duplicate_headers"] = true}`` as the ``options``.
- area: cluster
  change: |

- area: connection limit

    fixed a use-after-free bug in the connection limit filter.

removed_config_or_runtime:
# *Normally occurs at the end of the* :ref:`deprecation period <deprecated>`

new_features:
- area: tls
  change: |
    added fallback :ref:`fallback
    <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.transport_sockets.tls.v3.PrivateKeyProvider.fallback>`
    to support private key provider to fallback to boringssl tls handshake.
    If the private key provider isn't available (eg. the required hardware capability doesn't existed),
    Envoy will fallback to the BoringSSL default implementation when the fallback is true.
    The default value is false.
